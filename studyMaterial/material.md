## What is Git?

Git is the most popular version control system, its free, open source, fast and scalable.

A version control system record the changes made to our code over time in a special database called repository, we can look at our project history and see who and why and if we screw something up we can easily reverse our project to an earlier state.

With Git or any other version control system we can track history and work together.

VCS fall into 2 categories, Centralized and Distributed.

Centralized system, all team members connect to a central server to get the later copy of the code and to share their changes with others. The problem with centralized architecture is the single point of failure. If the server goes offline we cannot collaborate or save snapshots of our project so we have to wait until the server comes back online.

In Distributed systems we donâ€™t have this problem, every team member has a copy of the project with his history in their machine so we can save snapshots of our project locally on our machine. If the central server is offline we can synchronize our work directly with others.

Git is an example of a distributed version control systems.
