## Agiles Methodologies
Agile Methodology is a people-focused, results-focused approach to software development that respects our rapidly changing world. It’s centered around adaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times. It’s flexible, fast, and aims for continuous improvements in quality, using tools like Scrum and eXtreme Programming.

### How It Works
It works by first admitting that the old “waterfall” method of software development leaves a lot to be desired. The process of “plan, design, build, test, deliver,” works okay for making cars or buildings but not as well for creating software systems. In a business environment where hardware, demand, and competition are all swiftly-changing variables, agile works by walking the fine line between too much process and not enough.

Agile Methodology Overview
It abandons the risk of spending months or years on a process that ultimately fails because of some small mistake in an early phase. It relies instead on trusting employees and teams to work directly with customers to understand the goals and provide solutions in a fast and incremental way.

Faster, smaller. Traditional software development relied on phases like outlining the requirements, planning, design, building, testing, and delivery. Agile methodology, by contrast, looks to deploy the first increment in a couple weeks and the entire piece of software in a couple months.
Communication. Agile teams within the business work together daily at every stage of the project through face-to-face meetings. This collaboration and communication ensure the process stays on track even as conditions change.
Feedback. Rather than waiting until the delivery phase to gauge success, teams leveraging Agile methodology track the success and speed of the development process regularly. Velocity is measured after the delivery of each increment.
Trust. Agile teams and employees are self-organizing. Rather than following a manifesto of rules from management intended to produce the desired result, they understand the goals and create their own path to reach them.
Adjust. Participants tune and adjust the process continually, following the KIS or Keep It Simple principle.

### Benefits of Agile Methodology
The benefits of Agile are tied directly to its faster, lighter, more engaged mindset. The process, in a nutshell, delivers what the customer wants, when the customer wants it. There’s much less wasted time spent developing in the wrong direction, and the entire system is quicker to respond to changes.

Faster. Speed is one of the biggest benefits of Agile Methodology. A faster software development life cycle means less time between paying and getting paid. That, in turn, means a more profitable business.
Increased customer satisfaction. With Agile, customers don’t wait for months or years, only to get exactly what they didn’t want. Instead, they get iterations of something very close to what they want, very fast. The system adjusts quickly to refine the successful customer solution, adapting as it goes to changes in the overall environment.
Values employees. Employees whose ideas are valued are vastly more productive than those who are ordered to follow a set of rules. The Agile Methodology respects employees by giving them the goal, then trusting them to reach it. Since they’re the ones with their hands on the controls and the ones who see the obstacles that crop up every day, employees are in the best position to respond to challenges and meet the goals at hand.
Eliminates rework. By involving the customer at more than just the phases of requirements and delivery, the project remains on-task and in-tune with customer needs at every step. This means less backtracking and less “out on a limb” time between the time we do the work and the time the customer suggests revisions.
Best Practices
The list of best practices is long and involved, with dozens of tools to pick and choose. We’ve outlined a short list of the main benefits below.

Set priorities. A product backlog is a list of prioritized tasks maintained by a product owner.
Maintain small release cycles. The product should be released in increments every 2-4 weeks, with stakeholders giving feedback before proceeding.
Use pair programming. Two programmers work side-by-side at a single computer. This technique actually results in an identical degree of productivity to separate programming but delivers higher quality.
Refactor. Rework code regularly to achieve the same result with greater efficiency and clarity.
Use test-driven development. Code the unit test first to keep the project on task throughout. Test-driven development as an Agile best practice also produces greater employee engagement, since it transforms testing from a boring grind to a coding challenge.

Additional Resources
Make use of the non-product style tools and resources for success below, including the original Agile manifesto and a few downloadable templates for implementation.
Agile Manifesto. This is the original document that kicked off the Agile movement. It contains all 12 key tenets of the methodology at large.
Burn Down Charts. These are visual representations of work left vs remaining time.
Agile project plan. This is a tool for tracking the progress of the overall Agile project.
Agile product backlog. This helps product owners track and prioritize customer requirements.


## Scrum
Scrum is a hands-on system consisting of simple interlocking steps and components:

A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog.
The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a sprint backlog and plans to implement it.
The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). They assess progress in a meeting called a daily scrum.
The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.
At the sprint’s end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint.
Here’s an example of how Scrum works: Bill meets with a customer to discuss her company’s needs. Those needs are the product backlog. Bill chooses the most important tasks to work on in the next two weeks. His team meets in a daily scrum to target work for the day ahead and address roadblocks. At the end of the sprint, Bill delivers the work, reviews the backlog, and sets the goal for the next sprint. The cycle repeats until the software is complete.

### Definition of Scrum
Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software development.
The word scrum also is used in rugby to define a play where players struggle against each to gain possession of the ball. The goal of a scrum in software development is to perform at a high-performing level like a rugby team does in a scrum.
How Scrum Works
In a rugby scrum, all the players literally put their heads together. When it comes to software development, a scrum can be characterized by developers putting their heads together to address complex problems.
Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features — a.k.a. a product backlog. The team meets to discuss:
The backlog.
What still needs to be completed.
How long it will take.
Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called sprints:
Sprints are periods of time when software development is actually done.
A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to complete an item from the backlog.
The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product.
Each sprint ends with a sprint review.
Then the team chooses another piece of backlog to develop — which starts a new sprint.
Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.
In daily scrums, teams meet to discuss their progress since the previous meeting and make plans for that day.
The meetings should be brief — no longer than 15 minutes.
Each team member needs to be present and prepared.
The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.

### Who is in the Scrum?
In rugby, the forwards are involved in the scrum. In software development, three roles are defined in the scrum framework:
The scrum team does the work. It is the individuals who are working together in the sprints to produce the products.
The scrum master is part of the scrum team makes sure the team works in compliance with the scrum rules. This is not a manager.
The product owner represents the customer. This role prioritizes the backlog and coordinates the scrum teamwork. The product owner is a role similar to project manager in more traditional project management frameworks.
Benefits of Scrum
Rugby players try to gain control of the ball in the scrum and move it downfield. Software developers use scrum to move their projects quickly. And the benefits trickle down to software developers:
Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams. Team morale tends to be high.
Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.
The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they are needed.
Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI). This is attributed to:
Decreased time to market.
Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly.
Defects that are fewer and less costly.
Projects failing early and quickly when it’s less costly.
Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.

### Disadvantages of Scrum
While a rugby scrum may get rough and bloody, software developers shouldn’t have to worry about that. Nonetheless, scrum is not for all developer teams or software development projects. There are disadvantages to implementing scrum projects:
There is a danger of scope creep if stakeholders keep adding functionality to the backlog. This could be encouraged by the fixed deadline.
Scrum works best with small teams of experienced software developers. They need to be able to work quickly.
Scrum teams do not work well when the scrum master micromanages their work.
Losing any team members can hurt the progress of the project.
Scrum Best Practices
Teamwork wins rugby games and helps software developers create quality products. To get the best quality out of scrum:
Define requirements just in time to keep product features as relevant as possible.
Test and incorporate product owner feedback daily.
Sprint reviews with stakeholders need to be regular.
The scrum team needs to use the sprint retrospectives to improve how they work.
Conduct face-to-face conversations to reduce miscommunications.
Trust the teams to do the best job possible.
Allow the teams to self-organize around people’s skills, work styles and personalities.
Don’t burn out the team members. Respect the balance between their personal and professional lives to ease stress.
